                            If you hover your mouse cursor on a connected edge, the text blocks will change colors to indicate their types for your references.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Colors used to identify each type of the blocks: 
                            <span class="precondition-mouseover">Pre-condition color</span>
                            <span class="actionable-mouseover">Actionable color</span>
                            <span class="postcondition-mouseover">Post-condition color</span>
                        </li>
